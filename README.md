# Instructions
- navigate to https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/suggested/ in your browser on your computer. This goes without saying, but you'll need to be signed into your Intagram account
- copy the javascript code in followBot.js and paste it into the javascript console (you can open this in google chrome with `command + option + j`
- click enter
- watch the bot click the follow button for you. it will only follow up to 30 people at a time so your account doesn't get flagged
- if you wanna risk it, keep repating the steps above - WARNING: you can only follow/unfollow about 20 - 60 users an hour, and a maximum of 100-200 users in a day AND Instagram does not allow anyone to follow more than 7,500 people. Instagram will just prevent you from hitting the follow button if you do too many in a short period of time, so you're generally safe using this.
